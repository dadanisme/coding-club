## **SLIDE 1: Title & Overview (2 minutes)**

### Opening Hook

> "Welcome, young Padawans, to the Lightsaber Academy! Today we're going to master the Force... of Swift networking!"

**Show the slide, then engage:**

- "How many of you have used apps that load data from the internet?" _(pause for show of hands)_
- "Instagram, Twitter, weather apps - they all use the same fundamental concepts we'll learn today."

### Workshop Overview

> "We're building a Star Wars-themed lightsaber management app. By the end, you'll be able to create, read, update, and delete lightsabers through real HTTP requests."

**Key Points to Emphasize:**

- Real networking, not just theory
- 2 hours of hands-on coding
- You'll walk away with production-ready skills

**Transition:** _"Before we dive into networking, we need to understand a crucial Swift concept..."_

---

## **SLIDE 2: Functions as First-Class Citizens (12 minutes)**

### Opening Question

> "Who can tell me what makes Swift functions special compared to other data types?"

**Live Coding Demo (5 minutes):**

```swift
// Start typing this live
func greetJedi(name: String, formatter: (String) -> String) -> String {
    return formatter("Hello, \(name)")
}

let upperCase: (String) -> String = { $0.uppercased() }
let result = greetJedi(name: "Luke", formatter: upperCase)
print(result) // Show output: "HELLO, LUKE"
```

**Explain while coding:**

- "Notice how I'm passing `upperCase` just like any other parameter"
- "The function `formatter` becomes a variable inside `greetJedi`"
- "This is the foundation of completion handlers in networking"

### Interactive Check (2 minutes)

> "Turn to the person next to you and explain in your own words what just happened here."

_Walk around, listen to conversations, address misconceptions_

### Connection to Networking (3 minutes)

> "This concept is EXACTLY how networking works in iOS. When you make a network request, you pass a function that says 'hey, when you get the data back, call this function with the result.'"

**Key Takeaway:** _"Functions are just data - you can pass them around like any other value!"_

### Exercise Transition (2 minutes)

> "Let's practice this concept with a quick exercise before we jump into networking."

**Quick Exercise:**

- "Create a function that takes a lightsaber name and a formatting function"
- "Try making an `allCaps` formatter and a `lowercase` formatter"
- Give 3-4 minutes for coding

**Transition:** _"Perfect! Now that we understand function parameters, let's see how this applies to talking with servers..."_

---

## **SLIDE 3: HTTP Methods & JSON Basics (15 minutes)**

### HTTP Methods Introduction (5 minutes)

> "HTTP methods are like different ways to ask for things at a restaurant."

**Use analogies while showing the slide:**

- **POST** → "I'd like to order something new" (Create)
- **GET** → "What's on the menu?" (Read)
- **PATCH** → "Can you change my order slightly?" (Update)
- **DELETE** → "Cancel my order" (Delete)

### Industry Context (2 minutes)

> "Before we dive deeper, let me share something important - most iOS developers in the industry spend their time building CRUD applications. Whether you work at a startup or a big tech company, you'll primarily be creating, reading, updating, and deleting data."

**Real-world emphasis:**
- "Banking apps: Create accounts, read transactions, update profiles, delete cards"
- "Social media: Create posts, read feeds, update bios, delete comments" 
- "E-commerce: Create orders, read products, update cart, delete items"

### CRUD Connection (3 minutes)

> "Every app you use follows this pattern - Instagram posts, Twitter tweets, your shopping cart items."

**Interactive moment:**

- "What CRUD operations happen when you post a photo on Instagram?"
- Guide them: Create (POST the photo), Read (GET your feed), Update (edit caption), Delete (remove post)

### JSON & Codable Demo (7 minutes)

**Live Coding - Show the Lightsaber struct:**

```swift
struct Lightsaber: Codable {
    let name: String
    let color: String
    let creator: String
}
```

**Explain Codable:**

> "Codable is Swift's superpower for JSON. It's like having a universal translator between Swift objects and JSON data."

**Show JSON example:**

```json
{
  "name": "Luke's Lightsaber",
  "color": "blue",
  "creator": "Luke Skywalker"
}
```

**Live demonstrate encoding/decoding:**

```swift
let luke = Lightsaber(name: "Luke's Saber", color: "blue", creator: "Luke")
let jsonData = try JSONEncoder().encode(luke)
let decoded = try JSONDecoder().decode(Lightsaber.self, from: jsonData)
```

**Key Takeaway:** _"Codable handles all the boring JSON conversion for us - we just work with Swift objects!"_

**Transition:** _"Now let's see how to create new lightsabers on our server..."_

---

## **SLIDE 4: POST Requests & Creating Data (18 minutes)**

### Theory First (3 minutes)

> "POST requests are like mailing a package - you need an address, you need to tell them what's inside, and you need to actually send it."

**Explain the components:**

- URL (the address)
- Headers (what's in the package)
- Body (the actual data)
- Method (POST tells server "this is new data")

### Live Coding Demo (12 minutes)

**Start typing slowly, explaining each part:**

```swift
func createLightsaber(_ lightsaber: Lightsaber) {
    // Step 1: Where are we sending this?
    guard let url = URL(string: "\(baseURL)/lightsabers") else {
        print("Invalid URL")
        return
    }

    // Step 2: Create the request
    var request = URLRequest(url: url)
    request.httpMethod = "POST"  // Tell server this is new data
    request.setValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")

    // Step 3: Convert our lightsaber to JSON
    do {
        let jsonData = try JSONEncoder().encode(lightsaber)
        request.httpBody = jsonData
    } catch {
        print("Encoding failed: \(error)")
        return
    }

    // Step 4: Send it!
    let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in
        // This function will be called when we get a response
        if let error = error {
            print("Error: \(error)")
            return
        }

        print("Success! Lightsaber created")
    }

    task.resume() // Don't forget this!
}
```

**Pause frequently to ask:**

- "What do you think this line does?"
- "Why do we need to set the Content-Type header?"
- "What happens if we forget `task.resume()`?"

### Common Mistakes Alert (2 minutes)

> "The #1 mistake students make? Forgetting `task.resume()`. Your request just sits there doing nothing!"

**Show the mistake:**

```swift
let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { ... }
// Missing task.resume() - request never sends!
```

### Quick Exercise (1 minute)

> "In your head, walk through what happens when we call this function. What order do things happen?"

**Transition:** _"Great! Now that we can create lightsabers, let's learn how to retrieve them..."_

---

## **SLIDE 5: URLSession & GET Requests (15 minutes)**

### Theory Connection (2 minutes)

> "GET requests are the simplest - like asking 'what do you have?' No package to send, just ask and receive."

### Live Coding Demo (10 minutes)

```swift
func fetchLightsabers() {
    // Much simpler than POST!
    let url = URL(string: "\(baseURL)/lightsabers")!

    let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { data, response, error in
        // Same pattern as POST
        if let error = error {
            print("Error: \(error)")
            return
        }

        guard let data = data else {
            print("No data received")
            return
        }

        // Here's where it gets interesting
        do {
            let lightsabers = try JSONDecoder().decode([Lightsaber].self, from: data)
            print("Got \(lightsabers.count) lightsabers!")

            // UI updates must happen on main thread
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                // Update your SwiftUI @Published properties here
            }
        } catch {
            print("Decoding failed: \(error)")
        }
    }

    task.resume()
}
```

**Stop frequently to explain:**

- "Why is GET simpler than POST?"
- "What's this `DispatchQueue.main.async` about?"
- "Why do we decode to `[Lightsaber].self` instead of just `Lightsaber.self`?"

### UI Thread Explanation (3 minutes)

> "This is crucial - network responses come back on background threads, but UI updates must happen on the main thread."

**Show the pattern:**

```swift
// Wrong - will crash or behave weirdly
self.lightsabers = decodedLightsabers

// Correct - always wrap UI updates
DispatchQueue.main.async {
    self.lightsabers = decodedLightsabers
}
```

**Interactive Check:**

> "Why do you think Apple requires UI updates on the main thread?"

**Transition:** _"Now you can create and read - let's quickly cover update and delete..."_

---

## **SLIDE 6: PATCH & DELETE Operations (10 minutes)**

### Quick Pattern Recognition (3 minutes)

> "Good news - if you understand POST and GET, you already understand PATCH and DELETE!"

**Show the similarities:**

- Same URLSession.shared.dataTask pattern
- Same completion handler structure
- Same error handling approach
- Only difference: HTTP method and sometimes body

### PATCH Demo (3 minutes)

```swift
// Just like POST, but...
request.httpMethod = "PATCH"  // Different method
// Still need body with updated data
request.httpBody = try JSONEncoder().encode(updatedLightsaber)
```

### DELETE Demo (2 minutes)

```swift
// Even simpler
request.httpMethod = "DELETE"
// Usually no body needed - just the ID in the URL
let url = URL(string: "\(baseURL)/lightsabers/\(lightsaberId)")!
```

### Student Exercise Time (2 minutes)

> "Your turn! Pick either PATCH or DELETE and implement it following the same pattern we've used."

**Walk around, help students, common issues:**

- Forgetting to change the HTTP method
- Not including ID in URL for DELETE
- Forgetting task.resume()

**Transition:** _"Perfect! Now we have all CRUD operations. But what about the user experience?"_

---

## **SLIDE 7: Loading States & Error Handling (12 minutes)**

### User Experience Focus (2 minutes)

> "Raise your hand if you've ever used an app that just froze when loading data..."

_Get some hands up_

> "Frustrating, right? That's why loading states matter - users need feedback!"

### Loading States Demo (5 minutes)

**Show in the service class:**

```swift
@Published var isFetchingLightsabers = false
@Published var isCreatingLightsaber = false

func fetchLightsabers() {
    isFetchingLightsabers = true  // Show loading

    URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { data, response, error in
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            self.isFetchingLightsabers = false  // Hide loading
            // ... handle response
        }
    }.resume()
}
```

**In SwiftUI:**

```swift
if service.isFetchingLightsabers {
    ProgressView("Loading lightsabers...")
} else {
    // Show the actual data
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy (5 minutes)

**Show the pattern:**

```swift
@Published var errorMessage: String?

// In network calls:
if let error = error {
    self.errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
    return
}

// In UI:
.alert("Error", isPresented: .constant(service.errorMessage != nil)) {
    Button("OK") { service.errorMessage = nil }
} message: {
    Text(service.errorMessage ?? "")
}
```

**Key Points:**

- Always handle errors gracefully
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Give users a way to dismiss errors
- Consider retry logic for network failures

**Interactive Discussion:**

> "What are some errors that could happen during network requests?"

_Guide them to think about: no internet, server down, invalid data, etc._

**Transition:** _"Before we wrap up, let's talk about security..."_

---

## **SLIDE 8: Authentication Concepts (8 minutes)**

### Security Introduction (2 minutes)

> "So far, our API is completely open - anyone can access it. Real apps need authentication."

**Ask the class:**

- "How does Instagram know it's really you posting a photo?"
- "What happens when you log into an app?"

### Token-Based Authentication Flow (4 minutes)

**Walk through the process:**

1. **Login**: "User enters username/password"
2. **Token Generation**: "Server validates and returns a token - like a temporary key"
3. **Token Storage**: "App stores token securely (never the password!)"
4. **Authenticated Requests**: "Include token in every request"

**Show the header example:**

```swift
request.setValue("Bearer \(authToken)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization")
```

### Security Best Practices (2 minutes)

> "Three golden rules of mobile authentication:"

1. **Never store passwords** - only tokens
2. **Use secure storage** - Keychain, not UserDefaults
3. **Handle token expiration** - graceful re-authentication

**Real-world connection:**

> "This is exactly how your banking app, social media, everything works. The concepts are universal!"

**Transition:** _"Let's wrap up with some professional tips..."_

---

## **SLIDE 9: Best Practices & Next Steps (5 minutes)**

### Professional Development Tips (3 minutes)

**Emphasize these practices:**

- **Always handle errors gracefully** - Never crash the app
- **Show loading states** - Keep users informed
- **Use proper HTTP status codes** - 200, 201, 404, 500 all mean different things
- **Secure token storage** - Keychain for sensitive data

### Technology Evolution (2 minutes)

> "What we learned today uses completion handlers - the traditional approach. Apple now has async/await which makes this code even cleaner."

**Show the evolution:**

```swift
// Traditional (what we learned)
URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { data, response, error in
    // Handle response
}.resume()

// Modern async/await
let (data, response) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
```

> "Same concepts, cleaner syntax. You now understand the foundation!"

**Transition:** _"Time for your final challenge..."_

---

## **SLIDE 10: Workshop Challenge & Q&A (15 minutes)**

### Challenge Introduction (3 minutes)

> "Your mission, should you choose to accept it..."

**Present the enhancement options:**

- Search functionality (GET with query parameters)
- Data caching (persist lightsabers locally)
- Retry logic (handle network failures gracefully)
- Better error messages (user-friendly feedback)

> "Pick ONE that interests you most. You have 10 minutes!"

### Student Work Time (10 minutes)

**Instructor Role:**

- Walk around the room
- Help with technical issues
- Encourage experimentation
- Share interesting solutions you see

**Common challenges students face:**

- URL query parameters syntax
- UserDefaults vs Core Data for caching
- Retry timing and logic
- Localized error messages

### Wrap-up & Q&A (2 minutes)

**Closing remarks:**

> "You've learned the fundamental networking concepts that power every modern app. These same patterns work whether you're building the next Instagram or a simple weather app."

**Final Q&A:**

- "Any questions about what we covered?"
- "What part was most challenging?"
- "What are you excited to build next?"
